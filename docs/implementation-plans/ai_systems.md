Design Technolgist AI Systems  
  
* Bachelor's degree or equivalent practical experience.  
* 10 years of experience in a technical, UX, or design setting, or related experience.  
* 5 years of experience in front-end engineering, prototyping, or interactive systems.  
* Experience in prototyping state machines, conversational logic, and the unique challenges of building non-deterministic interfaces (LLMs, Agents).  
**Preferred qualifications:**  
* Experience integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) or Agentic tools into web-based prototypes.  
* Experience building orchestration logic or "middleware" for UX experiments.  
* A portfolio demonstrating prototypes that influenced product strategy or roadmap decisions.  
**About the job**At Google, we follow a simple but vital premise: "Focus on the user and all else will follow." Google’s UX Engineers are versatile and passionate about taking on new problems to drive progress and vision for design teams. They’re comfortable wearing many hats and get excited about working across discipline lines to develop products and prototypes that bring new ideas to life.  
  
* Google User Experience (UX) is made up of multi-disciplinary teams of UX Designers, Researchers, Writers, Content Strategists, Program Managers, and Engineers: we care deeply about the people who use our products. The UX team plays an integral part in gathering insights about the attitudes, emotions, and behaviors of people who use our products to inspire and inform design. We collaborate closely with each other and with engineering and product management to create industry-leading products that deliver value for the people who use them, and for Google’s businesses.  
  
* As a UX Engineer, you'll work as part of a UX team in a challenging, fast-paced environment. You’ll demonstrate your creativity, analytical skills, and knowledge of user facing technologies to create prototypes that identify the best product experiences, launch innovative features, build tools that accelerate UX teams, bridge between design and engineering discussions, and enable efficient, high quality execution. The Core team builds the technical foundation behind Google’s flagship products. We are owners and advocates for the underlying design elements, developer platforms, product components, and infrastructure at Google. These are the essential building blocks for excellent, safe, and coherent experiences for our users and drive the pace of innovation for every developer. We look across Google’s products to build central solutions, break down technical barriers and strengthen existing systems. As the Core team, we have a mandate and a unique opportunity to impact important technical decisions across the company.

**Responsibilities**  
* Move beyond UI to build agentic workflows. Work with model APIs, orchestration frameworks, and toolchains to implement realistic interactions where the "happy path" isn't guaranteed.  
* Create functional artifacts that challenge assumptions. Produce "unsolicited provocations" that channel the organization to grapple with new technical realities and emerging user experiences.  
* Partner with designers and strategists to "jam" in code. Iterate rapidly across fidelities to clarify direction and unblock decision-making during messy, early-stage conceptualization.  
* Identify technical constraints and opportunities by working directly with models. Ensure design strategy is grounded in technical reality, plotting a viable course from the start.  
* Partner with storytellers to package explorations into compelling demos. Enable leadership to experience the future firsthand through tangible, working prototypes.
